Hi there! I'm Di, a mechanical engineer with a passion for mechanics & coding. I blend the precision of engineering with the creativity of programming, constantly exploring new ways to solve complex problems.

Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alberta. Before this, I earned my bachelor's degree from Sichuan University, where I majored in Engineering Mechanics and Software Engineering. I enjoy tackling challenging problems, whether it's refining a numerical model or helping others achieve their technical goals.

If you're looking for someone who can bring a unique blend of skills to your project, you can find me on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01f679e2d4597a3feb?mp_source=share). Let's collaborate and create something amazing together!
